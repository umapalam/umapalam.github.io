An aspect of Sociology as a field of study is being able to detect patterns with a given set of data. This data is usually gathered during polling or from surveys. The information gathered provides either qualitative or quantitative data. We then construct graphs and produce analysis of this information to explain why a trend is occurring in society. 

Having a strong background in sociology led me to understand the similarities between this subject and data science. It was from this exposure to data gathering and analysis that I became interested in the field of data science. 

I found that programming was also something that was logical and straightforward to learn. I familiarized myself with the process of coding because of this logic. There were times where it was difficult to understand some new material but the resources to learn those materials were vast and could be located relatively easy using the internet. I also learned that data science was a field that specialized in creating visual representations of data. 

I believe that a person sees the impact of data when it is presented via graphs and charts. Lists of numerical values make it harder for the viewer to connect with what is being explained by the data. Data science helps bridge that understanding for the viewer so that they can make their own conclusions about the data and I find that to be the best part of this particular field.

It is very exciting that I am going to learn these skills. I want to expand my own skillset in coding even after this course is over as well. The experience of coding also encourages socialization between people from all over the world. This aspect of data science also brings about interesting and engaging experiences.
